# Material Design icons Art Provider for wxWidgets

This project contains a custom Art Provider for the wxWidgets containing all Material Design icons. 
The original icons were taken from the [SVG Material Design](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons) icons repository. 


Generation of the wxWidgets core header files is fully automated, hopefully in the future it will be integrated with the CI for updates to the base repo.

### License
This provider is released under the Apache 2.0 license, consistent with the Material Design icons
